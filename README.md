# DEP-internship
Projects I worked on during my internship in data science using Python are included in this repository. Every project uses machine learning techniques to investigate a distinct dataset and tackle a particular problem.
Description of the Data Science Project Repository:

The data science projects I worked on during my internship are displayed in this repository. Every project makes use of Python and machine learning methods to investigate various datasets and tackle certain issues.

Initiatives:

Boston Residence:
Objective: Estimate Boston's owner-occupied house median value.
Methodology: Regression models were employed to examine the variables impacting home values.

CIFAR-10:
Objective: Sort photos into ten pre-established groups.
Methodology: Convolutional neural networks and other deep learning techniques were used to extract information from images and provide predictions.

OpenCV:
Goal: Investigate applications and ideas in computer vision.
Approach: Used OpenCV libraries to implement a variety of image processing tasks.

Spam
Objective: Recognize spam emails.
Method: To identify emails as spam or not, natural language processing techniques were applied to examine the content of the emails.

Telcp:
The objective is to forecast client attrition in the telecom sector.
Method: Classification algorithms were used to determine which consumers were most likely to depart.
Technology

Pandas in Python
TensorFlow/Keras NumPy scikit-learn OpenCV NLTK

Note: Please see the corresponding project directory for further details on each project.
